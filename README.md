#Movie & TV Website 🎬

I developed a dynamic Movie & TV website that fetches all its data from an external API, providing users with a seamless experience to explore movies and TV shows. The platform allows users to:

    View detailed descriptions of movies and TV shows 📄
    See high-quality posters 🎞️
    Check ratings ⭐
    Browse by genres 🎭
    Search for movies by name 🔎

Built with clean and efficient code, this project ensures a smooth and interactive user experience while dynamically displaying content from the API. 🚀
